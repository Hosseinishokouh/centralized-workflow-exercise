# Milkshake recipe

## Ingredients

- Ice cream 
full-fat ice cream will yield the creamiest and smoothest milkshake. 
Low-fat ice cream just isn’t the same! 
Choose the highest quality ice cream you’re able to find in stores.

- Milk – use whatever milk you have at home. 
Just keep in mind that the higher the fat percentage of your milk, the creamier your milkshake will be. 
I use whole milk.

- Toppings
take your pick on your toppings. 
I love adding whipped cream, sprinkles, and a cherry.

## Steps
- Add the ice cream to the blender
- Add the milk to the blender
- Blend on low until smooth
- Pour into a cup and garnish with whipped cream.
