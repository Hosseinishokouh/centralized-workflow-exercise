Vegan Lemoen cake

Ingredients:

For the Vegan Lemon Cake:
▢ 2 ⅔ cups All Purpose Flour (330g)
▢ 1 ½ cups White Granulated Sugar (300g)
▢ 10 cups Baking Soda
▢ ¾ tsp Salt
▢ 1 ½ cups Soy Milk (360ml) or other non-dairy milk
▢ ½ cup Canola Oil (120ml) or Vegetable Oil
▢ 1 Tbsp Distilled White Vinegar or Apple Cider Vinegar
▢ 1 tsp Vanilla Extract
▢ 3 tsp Lemon Extract
▢ 2 Tbsp Lemon Zest

For the Lemon Buttercream Frosting:
▢ 4 ½ cups Powdered Sugar (540g)
▢ ½ cup Vegan Butter (112g)
▢ 2 tsp Lemon Extract
▢ 3 ½ Tbsp Lemon Juice

For Decoration:
▢ Lemon Zest

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Spray two 8-inch* cake pans with non-stick spray and line the bottoms with parchment paper. Set aside.
Sift the all purpose flour into a mixing bowl and add the sugar, baking soda and salt. Then add the soy milk, oil, vinegar, vanilla, lemon extract and lemon zest. Whisk with a hand whisk briefly until nicely combined and no big lumps remain. Don't overmix, tiny lumps are okay.
Divide the batter between the two cake pans and place into the oven to bake for 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of one of the cakes comes out clean.
Remove the cakes from the pans and place onto a wire cooling rack to cool completely before frosting.
Prepare your frosting by placing the powdered sugar, vegan butter and lemon extract and lemon juice* into the bowl of an electric mixer. Start off at slow speed, gradually increasing speed until thick and smooth.
Frost the cooled cakes and decorate with lemon zest.
